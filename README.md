WiFi Widget Demo (Android)
--------------------------

Basic widget demo app for Android. 

Provides boilerplate widget code, and some trivial network detection code. Code not of a particularly good quality, just thrown together quickly to get the proof-of-concept demo done.


Widget displays:
  - icon in color when connected to WiFi; grey when not connected
  - IP address of active WiFi connection


The only use I get out of this is to show me my IP so I can easily set up wireless debugging when I arrive at work each morning.
