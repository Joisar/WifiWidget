WiFi Widget Demo (Android)
--------------------------

Basic widget demo app for Android. 

Provides boilerplate widget code, and some trivial network detection code. Code thrown together quickly as a proof-of-concept demo.


Widget displays:
  - icon in color when connected to WiFi; grey when not connected
  - IP address of active WiFi connection


I use this widget to show me my IP so I can easily set up wireless debugging without having to open WiFi settings.

A working version of this demo can be downloaded from the Google Play store:
